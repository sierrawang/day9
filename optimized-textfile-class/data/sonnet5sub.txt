Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
To hideous winter and confounds him there,
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beautyâ€™s effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
 But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
 Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
